abstract: "We used 2013/2014 Canadian Community Health Survey to describe who bicycles for leisure, commuting, or both leisure and commuting. Nearly one-quarter of Canadians bicycled in the 3 months prior to the survey:  7 Canadians bicycled for leisure for every 1 person who bicycled for commuting purposes. People bicycling for leisure were more likely to be younger, male, higher income, and identify as white. Commute bicycling captured a very small proportion of the bicycling population; men were nearly twice as likely to commute compared to women and there was little difference in bike commuting across racial identity."
