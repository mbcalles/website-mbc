abstract: E-scooters are rapidly changing transportation in US cities and university campuses. Hailed as a convenient, inexpensive solution for “last mile” and other short trips, e-scooters are available in over 100 US cities and were used for nearly forty million trips in 2018. Yet relatively little is known about e-scooter use, including who uses them, for which types of trips, and the perceived benefits and barriers related to e-scooters. This information is particularly important in light of concerns about safety and the loss of physical activity (PA) due to replacing walking and biking with e-scooting. In this paper, we aim to characterize trends in the barriers and benefits related to e-scooter use within a professional population. We surveyed 1,256 university staff in Tempe, AZ, finding that 36% of respondents had ridden e-scooters and 40% indicated that they would do so outside of campus in the next year. Overwhelmingly, e-scooters are seen as a convenient way to travel, particularly in the heat and compared to walking. However, demographic differences were notable, particularly regarding barriers. African American and non-white Hispanic respondents were significantly more likely than non-Hispanic white respondents to intend to try e-scooters and to be unhappy with current transportation options. E-scooters are also associated with concerns about traffic safety – particularly for women – and barriers related to being able to find working equipment when needed. These findings suggest that e-scooters fill an important transportation niche and may contribute to transportation equity, and that efforts to address barriers could further enhance that contribution.

summary:     E-scooters used more for transport than recreation, potentially filling a niche. Also viewed as convenient, faster, and better in hot weather than walking.  Non-white non-riders significantly more likely to intend to try e-scooters. E-scooters disproportionately replace walking and bicycling for all trip types. Women significantly more likely to cite safety-related barriers to e-scooter use.
