Iâ€™m a health geographer and epidemiologist exploring relationships between injury, health, transportation, and social inequalities. My work combines spatial analysis with epidemiological methods to generate insights into public health challenges with a specific focus on road traffic injury and active transportation.

As a postdoctoral research fellow in the Road Safety & Public Health Research Lab at the University of British Columbia, I lead interdisciplinary research projects using large, linked administrative databases. My goal is to produce actionable findings that contribute to creating safer and more equitable communities.
