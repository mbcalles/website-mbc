I am a health geographer and epidemiologist specializing in advanced data analysis techniques to understand the complex relationships between injury, health, transportation, and socio-spatial inequalities. My interdisciplinary approach combines spatial analysis with robust epidemiological methods and non-spatial data analysis to provide comprehensive insights into public health challenges.

As a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of British Columbia, I lead research projects using complex, linked administrative databases. My work involves:

1. Epidemiological analysis of injury patterns and risk factors
2. Statistical modeling of health outcomes across diverse population groups
3. Integration and analysis of linked injury and traffic crash data sources, including police reports, auto-insurance claims, hospital admissions, vital statistics, and socioeconomic indicators

My research focus includes:
- Spatial patterns of transportation-related injuries
- Health inequities in injury risk and burden
- Critical evaluation of data sources in transportation injury research
- Development and application of novel analytical methods in injury epidemiology

My methodological expertise spans:
- Advanced statistical analysis and modeling
- Spatial analysis and GIS techniques
- Machine learning and predictive modeling
- Big data integration and management

My goal is to lead innovative research that bridges epidemiology, data science, and geography to address critical public health challenges. By leveraging diverse analytical methods and data sources, he aims to produce actionable insights that inform evidence-based policies for safer, more equitable communities.
