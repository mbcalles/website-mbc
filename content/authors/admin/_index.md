I am a health geographer interested in answering applied questions at the intersection of transportation, safety and health. I received my Ph.D in 2020 from the faculty of Health Sciences at Simon Fraser University in the Cities, Health and Active Transportation Research (CHATR) Lab. In my Ph.D I used a variety of novel datasets (volunteered geographic information, as well as longitudinal and cross-sectional survey data) to evaluate the objective and perceived safety of bicycling. I completed my M.Sc in the department of Geography at the University of Victoria in 2015 in the Spatial Pattern Analysis and Research (SPAR) Lab where I used machine learning and GIScience approaches to map indoor radon in the province of BC.

I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of British Columbia and at Ryerson University. In my postdoctoral research I am working to quantify injury and mortality risks amongst Canadian active transport users (bicyclists and pedestrians) using large population-based linked datasets.
