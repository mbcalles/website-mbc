Iâ€™m a health geographer and epidemiologist focused on using advanced data analysis to explore the complex relationships between injury, health, transportation, and social inequalities. My work combines spatial analysis with epidemiological methods to generate comprehensive insights that can address critical public health challenges.

As a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of British Columbia, I lead interdisciplinary research projects using complex, linked administrative databases. My goal is to produce actionable findings that contribute to creating safer and more equitable communities.

## My Research

I specialize in the following areas:

- **Injury Epidemiology**: Analyzing patterns of injury and risk factors across populations.
- **Spatial Analysis**: Using Geogaraphic Information Systems to combine health outcome data with geographic data and analyze spatial patterns of risk.
- **Linked Data**: Merging and analyzing large, linked datasets from police reports, insurance claims, hospital admissions, and more to uncover insights into transportation-related injuries.
- **Health Inequities**: Investigating how injury risks and burdens vary across different population groups.
