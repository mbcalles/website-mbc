Iâ€™m a health geographer and epidemiologist focused on using advanced data analysis to explore the complex relationships between injury, health, transportation, and social inequalities. My work combines spatial analysis with epidemiological methods to generate comprehensive insights that can address critical public health challenges.

As a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of British Columbia, I lead interdisciplinary research projects using complex, linked administrative databases. My goal is to produce actionable findings that contribute to creating safer and more equitable communities.

## My Research

I specialize in the following areas:

- **Injury Epidemiology**: Analyzing patterns of injury and risk factors across populations.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Using advanced models to understand health outcomes in diverse groups.
- **Data Integration**: Merging and analyzing large, linked datasets from police reports, insurance claims, hospital admissions, and more to uncover insights into transportation-related injuries.

## Key Focus Areas

- **Transportation Injuries**: Mapping and analyzing spatial patterns of injuries related to transportation.
- **Health Inequities**: Investigating how injury risks and burdens vary across different population groups.
- **Data Source Evaluation**: Critically assessing and improving data quality in transportation injury research.

## My Expertise

I apply a range of advanced techniques in my work, including:

- **Statistical Analysis**: Developing and applying models to explain injury trends and health outcomes.
- **Spatial Analysis & GIS**: Mapping injury patterns and exploring geographic disparities.
- **Machine Learning**: Using predictive models to identify factors that influence injury risk.
- **Big Data Integration**: Managing and analyzing complex datasets to generate meaningful insights.
